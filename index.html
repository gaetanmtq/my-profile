  <h2>My hobbies ?</h2>
   <p>I was born on an island, so almost all my hobbies are related to the sea. I love the contact with the sea and the sensations that water sports provide. Since I was a child I have been practicing sports like kitesurfing, windsurfing or dinghy sailing. But I also play soccer and tennis in competition. I did the Junior Roland Garros in 2015, it was a great experience!</p>

   <h2>My passions ?</h2>
    <p>During this course, I am currently enjoying the code which is very new to me, so I would like to discover more and maybe it will become a passion! Today, my passion is music, sports and travelling. I've been playing the saxophone for 5 years, I started by watching a video of Charlie Parker. I like the values of sport in general so I try to practice as much as possible. And I had the chance to travel in the USA and Europe but I would like to discover Asia next time.

  <h2>My project ? </h2>
   <p>My big project concerns an association that I would like to create in Martinique. It will serve social and ecological causes. The goal will be to gather people in order to carry out local actions on the environment where nature is polluted such as beaches, mountains. The same principle is already applied in Guadeloupe and is called "Clean up my island". You can click on the official page of their facebook on the link below for more information.</p>
